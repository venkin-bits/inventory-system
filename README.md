# Image Encryption Service

A web-based image encryption service that supports XOR and Caesar cipher algorithms. Users can upload images, select the encryption method, and securely encrypt or decrypt images using custom keys. This project demonstrates practical cryptography concepts through an interactive web application.

Project Url : https://image-encryption-decryption-service.onrender.com/

## Features

- Upload images in standard formats (JPG, PNG, GIF).
- Choose between XOR and Caesar cipher encryption algorithms.
- Encrypt or decrypt images with a customizable key (0-255).
- Preview original and processed images before downloading.
- Simple and responsive UI for ease of use.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
3. Upload an image, select an encryption algorithm.
4. Choose operation (Encrypt/Decrypt) and enter a key.
5. Click "Process Image" to see the encrypted or decrypted result.
6. Download the processed image.

## How it Works

- **XOR Algorithm:** Applies a bitwise XOR operation using the key on each pixel.
- **Caesar Cipher:** Shifts pixel color values by the key amount, similar to text Caesar cipher.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for front-end.
- Core encryption algorithms implemented in JavaScript.
